# tensorflow-2-and-keras-bootcamp
Course: Complete Tensorflow 2 and Keras Deep Learning Bootcamp by Jose Portilia. There are notebooks which I made while watching this course and I also implemented some of my own basic things while learning. Hope it helps.

You can find this course on https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-tensorflow-2-and-keras-deep-learning-bootcamp/

## Below is the Structure

1. Numpy Crash Course
2. Pandas Crash Course
3. Data Visualization Crash Course
4. Basic Artificial Neural Networks - ANNs
5. Convolutional Neural Networks - CNNs
6. Recurrent Neural Network - RNNs
7. Natural Language Processing - NLP
8. AutoEncoders
9. Generative Adversarial Networks - GANs
10. Deployment


My Favorite part was from ANNs till RNNs. So in those sections I tried few stuffs to play around



**Important if you are interested in Deployment Section**

In Deployment section, you will find "Final_Deployment" folder. All files in that folder are the files you will need for heroku.
